In this game, the player controls the hero using the four arrow keys. The hero must collect 20 eggs from the dragons’ lair to win the game. Each dragon sleeps and wakes up at different times. If the hero is near a dragon when it’s awake, the player loses a life. The game ends when the player runs out of lives or collects enough eggs.
